# Todo

- Get familiar with Pocketbase's DB layer and make sure autoCancellation works as intended

> right now it cancels all "similar" request e.g. when adding a bunch of records. I'm not sure this is how it was designed.

- OOP approach or code restructure

> Right now I'll try to split the code into /lib/ files so it can be organized. But I'm not sure I'm doing it right so make sure to study NextJS properly.

- Components refactoring

> Some of the components are too bloated with logic. Again, I'm not sure I've done them properly. Refactor.

- Create a DB abstraction.

> Pocketbase is used here. However I'm not sure this is the right choice though I like its flexibility in some way. So the abstraction could go here to substitute PB with something else if needed.

- Study Tailwind / othe framework

> I've chosen the Tailwind as it was built in and easy to use. However the learning curve is foo high so maybe that's not the right choice. Additionally I should investigate whether it is possible to "change theme" while using Tailwind. And I don't like the className styling approach as it's in some way similar to adding inline css.
