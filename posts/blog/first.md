## Initial post
Hey there! I've started working on system, but it's hella work.
I have to study the JS + styling. And to deploy all the stuff I use my own Synology and it has some issues with NPM. Luckily I do have experience working with servers.

Decided to start with Broken Compass TTRPG. The basic data structure is ready, now going to add fields.
Have some issues with "Feels". they are going to be "Compendium" items. I think I'll call them "Compendium Palette" - the menu where you can take some pre-installed features (like spells, skills, etc) and drag-n-drop on Character Sheet.

I have a large roadmap including deployment strategies, external modules and compendium support, UI design and etc.
